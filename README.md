# microprocessor-request-with-ajax
Hi, i want to create a simple website. This should have a button on it to build a connection to a microprocessor as a server and get a simple value back. My problem is, that it hasnt to built a new connection every time a request is sent. it shall get a value from the server over time (around 10 secs).
